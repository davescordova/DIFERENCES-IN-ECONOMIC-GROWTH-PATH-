## üìÑ Abstract

Using the framework of Institutional Economics, this thesis investigates the economic development of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. It argues that the new institutions established since the 1960s have been pivotal in paving the way for the state's significant economic growth.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Methodology

The analysis was conducted using a **Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)** model on panel data with fixed effects. The primary software tools used were:

* **üêç Python**: Used for creating maps, graphs, exploratory data analysis, and data visualizations.
    * *Key libraries: `pandas`, `geopandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `esda`, `libpysal`.*

* **üíß Julia**: Employed for plotting geospatial data, such as the location of federal highways in the state.
    * *Key libraries: `GeoDataFrames`, `Plots`, `Shapefile`, `GeoJSON`, `ArchGDAL`.*

* **üìà Stata**: Utilized for the core econometric regressions of the study.
