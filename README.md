This Github store not only the codes bul also the data from my Master's thesis which will be placed here also, as soon as it will be published. 
Using Institutional Economy, the thesis prove that newer institutions in Mato Grosso, that came since the 1960s, paved the way to economic growth in Mato Grosso, Brazilian state.

The data is based on the file Base de dados - Regress√£o.xlsx to make the regressions in Stata, which lead to Two Stage Least Square Model in panel data with fixed effects.
The specification is shown at the do-files as also the texts.
Furthermore, there are Jupyter Notebooks files writen in Julia, which were used to plot the locations and the data, and also in Python, which are used to make both maps and graphs.

They can be achieved through the main branch, but are divided trough five other branches:
The davescordova-patch-data contain all the data used, while davescordova-patch-Stata-Graphs cointain the outdated graphs made in Stata.
In davescordova-patch-Do-files is located the Stata do-files, in davescordova-patch-Julia there is the maps made in Julia and in davescordova-patch-Python there the up-to date graphs made in such language.
